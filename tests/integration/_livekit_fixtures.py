"""Synthetic LiveKit event generators for the e2e integration tests.

The adapter responds to four LiveKit events (``transcript_segment_received``,
``on_user_turn_completed``, ``session_ends``, and an optional
``interesting_fact_detected`` heuristic). These helpers produce the
*shape* of those payloads so the e2e tests can drive the adapter
against a real Musubi stack without a running LiveKit SFU.

Kept deliberately small: the adapter tests are about the adapter <>
Musubi contract, not about simulating LiveKit's WebRTC wire format.
