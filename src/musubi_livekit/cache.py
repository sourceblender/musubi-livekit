    Both the Slow Thinker (pre-fetch) and the Fast Talker (speech turn) publish to it on EVERY
    retrieval — success, degraded, or total failure. To get correct current-turn semantics under
    OVERLAP (requests can complete out of order — an older slow request may finish after a newer fast
    one), publication is guarded by a monotonic GENERATION: a caller allocates a generation with
    :meth:`begin` at retrieval START, and :meth:`publish` only takes effect if that generation is not
    older than the last one published. So a stale (older) completion can never clobber the status of
    the context actually delivered, while a newer completion (healthy or degraded) always wins.

    All mutation is synchronous (no ``await`` inside), so under asyncio's single-threaded scheduling
    ``begin``/``publish`` are atomic and no lock is needed.
